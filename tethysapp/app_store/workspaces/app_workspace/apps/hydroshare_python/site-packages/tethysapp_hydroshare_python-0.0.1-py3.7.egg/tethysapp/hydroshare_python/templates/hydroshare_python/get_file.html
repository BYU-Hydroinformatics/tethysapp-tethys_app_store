  <h1 style="color:rgb(16, 73, 14)">Create a Resource</h1>
  <p>The ‘Create a Resource’ feature allows the user to create a new resource in their HydroShare account, which would contain all files they intend to upload. The resources in the user’s HydroShare account are created with a certain amount of prerequisites like author name, keywords, metadata and the title of your resource. The Python API provided by HydroShare helps in completing this task. Below are step by step instructions on how to create a new resource.  </p>
  <p></p>
  <form id="add-dam-form" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
    {% csrf_token %}
    <p>The way you could go about performing this function is by following the instructions below:</p>
    <h3>Step 1: Sign into HydroShare using your credentials</h3>
    

    <p>In the boxes below enter your HydroShare username and password. If you need to make a HydroShare account, <a href="https://www.hydroshare.org/sign-up/?next=">click here</a>.</p>
    {% if not loggedin %}
    {% gizmo username_input %}
    {% gizmo password_input %}
    {% else %}
    <h4> You are logged into HydroShare </h4>
    {% endif %}
    <p></p>
    <h3>Step 2: Enter the metadata as indicated below</h3>
    <p></p>
    <p>Enter the name of the Author and co-authors if you have any, this helps with sharing access and making things available to people who could contribute to the project.</p>
    <p></p>
    {% gizmo author_input %}
    <p></p>
    <p>The title of the project is basically the name of your resource. Try to keep it short, but descriptive in order to avoid confusion when others search for your data. </p>
    {% gizmo title_input %}
    <p></p>
    <p>The keywords are used to sort your resource with respect to its type and helps others find your data quickly when searching for a resource using these keywords.</p>
    {% gizmo owner_input %} 
    <p></p>
    <p>Type in your abstract in the tab below that would help explain your resource to another fellow user. Try not using more than 200 words.</p>
    {% gizmo date_built_input %}
    <p></p>
    <h3>Step 3: Choose the file that you want to upload to the new resource that you are creating and click the 'Create' button below:</h3>

    <input id="uploaded-file" type="file" name="uploadedfile"/>
    <p></p>
    {% gizmo create_button %}
    

  </form>
