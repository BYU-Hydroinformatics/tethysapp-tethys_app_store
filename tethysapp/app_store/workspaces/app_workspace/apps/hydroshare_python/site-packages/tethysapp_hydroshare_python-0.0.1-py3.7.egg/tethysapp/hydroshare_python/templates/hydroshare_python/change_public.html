  <h1 style="color:rgb(16, 73, 14)">Change the type of resource from 'Private' to 'Public' </h1>

  <p>This feature of the app helps changing the type of a resource that is present on the HydroShare database. The option to change it from private to public works very smoothly and it is required because the resources that are private are not very accessible to the general user at HydroShare.</p>

  <h3>Step 1: Enter in your username and password</h3>
    <p>In the boxes below you enter your HydroShare username and its password. If you have to make an HydroShare account, <a href="https://www.hydroshare.org/sign-up/?next=">click here</a>.</p>
    {% if not loggedin %}
    {% gizmo username_input %}
    {% gizmo password_input %}
    {% else %}
    <h4> You are logged into HydroShare </h4>
    {% endif %}
    <p></p>
    <h3>Step 2: Enter in the Resource ID of the resource you want to change to 'Public'</h3>
  
    <p>The resource ID is a unique identifier for every resource on HydroShare. You can find it by clicking on your resource in HydroShare, scrolling down to the “How to Cite” section, and copying the ID from the URL. This is an example hyperlink: https://www.hydroshare.org/resource/08c6e88adaa647cd9bb28e5d619178e0/ from which The 32 letter combination at the end is called the resource ID. The resource ID from the example hyperlink is <mark>08c6e88adaa647cd9bb28e5d619178e0</mark>. </p>

  <p>To try this on your own, you can use the code snippet below, or download the full javascript file that is used in this demonstration.</p>
  <pre class="line-numbers">
    <code class="language-python">
<mark>from hs_restclient import HydroShare, HydroShareAuthBasic</mark>
auth = HydroShareAuthBasic(username='myusername', password='mypassword')
hs = HydroShare(auth=auth)
hs.setAccessRules('ID OF RESOURCE GOES HERE', public=True)
